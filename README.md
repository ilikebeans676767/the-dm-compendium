## Features

- Insert formatted monsters, spells, and items from the command palette.
- Generate monster statblock YAML compatible with popular Obsidian TTRPG tools.
- Render inline spell and item cards in reading view.
- Choose which D&D sources are included in search results.
- Cache selected compendium data locally for faster searching after the first load.

## Usage

1. Open the command palette.
2. Run **The DM Compendium: Insert from compendium**.
3. Choose monsters, items, or spells.
4. Search for an entry and select it to insert formatted content at the cursor.

To refresh cached data manually, run **The DM Compendium: Refresh database**.

You can assign custom shortcuts for these commands from **Settings > Hotkeys**.

## Settings

Open **Settings > Community plugins > The DM Compendium** to choose which sources appear in search results.

## TTRPG plugin compatibility

Monster inserts are designed to work especially well with the Obsidian TTRPG Community plugins:

- [Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/fantasy-statblocks)
- [Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/initiative-tracker)
- [Dice Roller](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/dice-roller)

Inserted monsters use `statblock` code blocks with YAML fields expected by Fantasy Statblocks, including the Basic 5e layout. With those plugins installed, the generated monster cards can be used as rendered statblocks, added to a bestiary, added to the initiative tracker, and used for rolling HP, attacks, and other supported rolls directly from the card.

## Disclosures

- **Network access:** The plugin downloads selected compendium JSON files from the GitHub API at `api.github.com/repos/guykahalani/the-dm-compendium` when the local cache is missing, when sources are changed, or when the refresh command is run.
- **Local file access:** The plugin writes cache files into its own plugin folder under `.obsidian/plugins/the-dm-compendium/cache`.
- **Account requirements:** No account is required.
- **Telemetry and ads:** The plugin does not collect telemetry, analytics, or usage data, and it does not show ads.
- **Platform support:** This plugin is desktop-only because it uses Node.js filesystem APIs for local caching.
